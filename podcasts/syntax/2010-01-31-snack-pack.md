### Notes

#### Fave features coming to HTML 5.2

* Can use `<dialog>` box to create a modal popup. Has ability to use new JavaScript API `open` and `close`. It's a div so you can style as you like.
* Can use multiple `<main>` tags as long as only one is visible at a time
* Understand high level concepts, but you can always look up syntax
* When learning concepts, come up with metaphor or relate it to something you already understand

#### Frameworks and Libraries

* Wes doesn't use CSS libraries or frameworks in a lot of cases
* Has used Foundation and Bootstrap in the past, but not anymore (personal preference)
* Uses it when only focusing on the functionality
* A lot frameworks have more layouts than you actually need; lotta wasted space
* Create basic layouts, basic helper classes, etc
* React Native - use native base
* CSS Grid would replace some of the frameworks
* Good use case for frameworks: Hobby project to learn a javascript framework, don't have to worry about styles.

#### Struggles you had early in coding journey

* Scott: working with error messages
* Scott: first experience with server side language was with Magento
* Wes: Wordpress white screen of death
* Read actual error message
* Stack trace shows you the steps until the error is reached
* Learn to troubleshoot your own stuff
* Wes: impatience, wanted to make amazing things right away. Your skills will get exponentially better and faster if you keep working on stuff.

#### Motivation

* Build exciting projects to help get motivated

#### Sick picks
