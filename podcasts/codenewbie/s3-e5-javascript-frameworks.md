## S3:E5 JavaScript Frameworks with Sarah Drasner

### Notes

* Overwhelmed with JS Frameworks - so many frameworks! New ones all the time
* Sarah Drasner - Vue core team member, cloud advocate for Microsoft, CSS Tricks writer
* Sarah really loves coding
* Vue.js is a progressive framework
* Can adopt it in many ways
* Vue can code tiny bits of functionality
* Vue CLI - entire build process
* Vue easy to integrate into projects
* Vue set up to be flexible
* Directive is a small bit of html to capture data
* Computed properties can make it easy to filter inputs
* If you're using jQuery, Vue is not necessarily harder than it
* jQuery is always calling to the DOM
* Vue outputs things to the DOM from the JS
* Capturing and typing stuff in inputs. jQuery - always listen for the keypress, listening for different events. Vue - automatically listening to what you're typing no matter what kinda keypress. Does the work for you.
* Vue is a reactive tool
* If you worked with Excel or Google sheet, and have calculations in .. the cell would automatically update
* Vue listens to the results rather than the "ingredients"
* Imperative to declarative
* We usually learn by programming as if following a recipe
* Allow computer to make the calls for you, without walking through all the steps
* Sarah says Vue is easy to read
* Can't help but compare Vue to React to Angular to Knockout
* Thinking about JavaScript as a buffet so it doesn't feel so overwhelming
* Work with frameworks for a couple of hours (at least four hours is suggested) to get a feel for 'em
* Vue has got a thing called 'watchers' (can't get there in four hours)
* Within four hours, you can get a feel for how it handles syntax and basic things
* In Sarah's opinion, React has an amazing community, and ecosystem
* React has React Native. Can work for mobile applications too
* Vue is younger than React
* Evan (creator) knew about those existing frameworks, and took things from each of them
* Directives from Angular, View from React, Watchers from Knockout, etc
* Vue borrows from other ideas
* Vue - most elegant solution to Frontend problems
* Good documentation
* Criticism of frameworks for beginners - if focusing too much on framework before language, you're not understanding it fully
* First vanilla javascript first?
* Sarah used jQuery way before JavaScript, Ruby after learning Rails
* Doesn't hurt learning Vanilla JavaScript first! (On that note, I should continue reading Eloquent JavaScript)
* Sarah - passion driven development. Do what excites you more!
* Learn what you find curious
* Look at frameworks that have growth

### Sarah Drasner

* Started 15 years ago after college
* Worked as a scientific illustrator, drew dead lizards and snakes, etc for science journals and encyclopedias
* Drawings - everything in focus. Photo - depth of field.
* Started making websites for the same company with tables and stuff
* Started with HTML for Dummies book
* Webmaster - person who was in charge of the place
* Websites about scientific stuff - milipedes, fish, etc
* Became an art professor in Greek islands, take students to Greece, Turkey, etc
* Back in United States, took job in an agency
* Got obsessed with coding
* Excitable and curious person, but can experience burnout when taking too much on
* SVG Animation made her excited about code again
* Too many dichotomies - not very helpful. BE vs FE.
* More different kind of things you do, you're expanding your brain
* Studied categories in grad school
* Why did we need to categorise things? Even what people do?
* Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things (book)
* First coding project for herself was her own site to see how things work. Playground.
* Wish she knew how to debug properly when she first started
* People not methodical when they debug at first - throw things into the problem
* Isolation helps with debugging, not change too much at once
