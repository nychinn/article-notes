### Notes

* Often a line drawn between a vector artist and a frontend developer
* Some people want to focus on FE dev, some on illustration
* An FE dev would benefit greatly from working on illustration
* Both skills are essentially putting together diff components to create final product
* Vector illustrators put together various shapes, and manips of shapes to create final illust
* FE devs put together coded components to form a web page
* Learning vector graphics teaches you about layouts, colour palettes, manips of shapes and overall creativity which can carry over to FE dev
* Pure CSS images are an example of intersection between illust and FE dev
* Creating a pure CSS image is basically designing a vector graphic with code

* Some divs would be nested within other divs ie) the ears, and the eyes
