* Importance of getting shit done
* Care about craft and end product
* Don't use quality as an excuse to procrastinate
* Some people paint the word "average" as a bad word but its not a bad thing. You should be proud of yourself because you worked hard to get to that point!
* Don't compare yourself to the unicorn developer. If you're doing better than your former self, you're doing good!
* Programming is not about coding, its about helping people
* Work is essentially servitude - providing people with something that they need
* Servitude as an employee - being hired to do a job and improve the lives of the customers that use the products, help colleagues grow, make company look good
* Servitude as a manager - there to support your sub-ordinates and make things easier for them to allow them to do better at their job

### Don't use quality as an excuse to procrastinate

* It comes in many forms for programmers
	* writing elaborate framework/library
	* restructuring code
	* spending too much time naming things
	* activities that feel like work, but don't make progress towards end product
* Empty productivity calories

### Don't use shipping as an excuse to do things that are wrong/sloppy
* Ask yourself why, keep yourself and managers accountable. Don't just accept things that are said. Think about them and spend time to understand what's going on
* Don't take irresponsible amounts of "tech debt"
* "Tech Debt" - hacks to make it work by ship time, but might take longer to fix afterwards
* Get sh-t done today, and maintain your capability of getting sh-t done next month
* Constantly ask why and act responsibility
