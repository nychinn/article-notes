### Notes

* Take a look at media queries for responsive design today
* When using floats, we create grid by using % to calculate columns. To change size/proportions we need to use media queries
* Flexbox, Grid Layout and Multi-column layout are responsive by default and enables responsive design without us having to do much
* `flex-basis: 250px;` to wrap if there's no space for two 250px items
* When creating breakpoints, consider moving away from pixels
* Consider looking at vertical media queries as well
