### Notes

* It's about instructing computers
* Programming is the act of constructing a program
* A program is a set of precise instructions, that tell computer what to do
* Computers are dumb, so you have to be very clear about what you want it to do

#### On Programming

* Programming languages are used to instruct computers
* With programming, you are building your own maze that you might get lost in
* "When action grows unprofitable, gather information; when information grows unprofitable, sleep" - Ursula K. Le Guin, The Left Hand of Darkness
* What is a program?
	* Text typed by programmer
	* Driving force to make computer do what it does
	* Data in computers memory; controls actions on same memory
	* Lots of seperate parts that come together to make the whole thing work
* Computers can only do straightforward things, but at an incredibly high speed
* Program combines all these simple actions to do more complicated things
* Without consideration, programs can grow outta control and become confusing
* Art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity. Simplify complexity

#### Why Language Matters

* In the beginning, there were no programming languages. They were made of 0's and 1's
* To program early computers, you need to set large arrays of switches or punch holes in strips of card
* The same program can be expressed in unreadable/readable ways
* A good language helps the programmer by allowing them to talk about actions clearly

#### What is JavaScript?

* Introduced in 1995 as a way to add progrms to webpages on Netscape
* Has since been adopted into all major graphic browsers
* Has made modern web apps possible
* Be able to interact directly with elements without have to reload the page
* JavaScript has nothing to do with Java
* Similar name to Java was driven by marketing .. since Java was getting quite popular at the time, and someone thought it would be good to ride on its success
* ECMAScript and JavaScript can be used interchangeably
* JS designed to be easy for beginners to pick up
* Is pretty flexible but this also makes it hard to find problems, because the system doesn't point them out to you
* Some databases like MongoDB and CouchDB use JS as their scripting and query language
* Some platforms for desktop/server programming provide an environment for programming JS outside of the browser (such as Node.js)

#### Code, and what to do with it

* Both reading code and writing code are indispensable parts of learning to program
* Author advises to read the code closely and try to understand as well as possible, even if it seems slow and confusing

#### Overview of this book

* First 12 chapters discuss JS language itself
* Next seven chapters are about web browsers and the way JS is used to program them
* Last two chapters are devoted to Node.js
* Five project chapters: building a robot, programming language, platform game, paint program, dynamic website
* Control structures, functions, data structures -> write simple programs
* Learn to write more abstract code and keep complexity under control
* Error handling and fixing, regular expressions, modularity, aynchronous programming
